As a firm believer of [GitOps](https://www.gitops.tech/), I see Developers having access to production is not far and is going to be the new normal. GitOps is the new normal.

## Client server architecture
Docker is based on client-server architecture with docker-daemon being the server accepting command from docker-client.

Docker-client can be either a command line utility or API call.

## Docker Daemon

docker-daemon process talks to the linux kernal via library called libcontainer (part of Docker project).
docker-daemon is often referred to as **Docker Engine** or **Docker Server**

On typical linux installation, all docker-client, docker-daemon and any containers runs on the same host.

## Docker Machine

On Windows/Mac, docker-daemon would run inside a Docker-Machine. <br>
Which is a light weight **Linux VM**, made specially to run the docker-daemon for Windows/Mac

<!-- Docker for Windows/Mac run as a **native** Windows/Mac app and manages a Linux VM internally. -->
