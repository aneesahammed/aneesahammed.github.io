Notes


Docker Compose & Docker Swarm Mode
In order to coordinate 10s or 100s of containers and the network connections amongst them and to ensure availablity and ability to scale.

Docker Compose
-used to control multiple containers on a single system.
-which image to use
-how many instances
-network connections


Docker Swarm Mode
Swarm Mode tells Docker that we'll be running many docker engines.
and wanted to coordinate operations across all of them.
-define and maintain hight availability levels
-scaling
-load balancing.
-most prod swarms have at least 3 "manager" nodes & many "worker" nodes.
-three mgrs is the minimum to have a true high-availability cluster.


First thing
#>tell Docker hosts that we want to use Docker Swarm Mode.

NODE:1 (Manager)
docker swarm init --advertise-addr $(hostname -i)

- to add a worker to this swarm
$ docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-erb 192.168.0.27:2377

- to add a manager to swarm
$ docker swarm join-token manager

NODE:2 (Worker)
$ docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-150w3ao6f92avvijmn4ejhz73g7o2s5zy6j9jxo0yp79aaftna-1xfbb7n8gbqj567538dv8k34u 192.168.0.27:2377


- Check the number of nodes in the swarm.
$ docker node ls
/* you cannot run this command in worker node */

If your Leader node goes down for some reason, the other manager nodes will elect a new leader; just one reason why you would always have multiple manager nodes in true production.


Deploy a Stack

- stack = services + task(containers)
- file to define stack = docker-stack.yml
