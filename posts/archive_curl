As part of my journey as a developer and decision to document my learning,
I've been thinking of writing a short post regarding curl, here it is.

Curl is a command line tool for transferring data to and from a server.
Curl stands for **Client URL** and was developed by a Swedish developer **Daniel Stenberg** [@bagder](https://twitter.com/bagder).

It covers many protocols like HTTP, FTP, IMAP, POP3 & SMTP, It usually comes  pre-installed in most of Linux distros and modern versions of OS X. <br>
If you're using Windows you can either download it from [here](https://curl.haxx.se) or you can use [git bash](https://git.scm.com)

Curl has got ton of options, to see all the different options you can try the below command

```
curl --help
```

In this post, we'll be working with [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com),
which is basically a fake online REST API that we can use for testing.



## GET Request

```
curl https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
```

if you'd like to see header information along with request's response
use flag **'-i'**

```
curl -i https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/3
```

in case if you just want to get only header, use **'--head'** or **'I'** flag
```
curl --head https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/3
```
```
curl -I https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/3
```

Often we wish to ouput the response contents into a file, for this we can use lowercase **'o'** or **'- -output'** flag.
```
curl -o filename.txt https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/3
```

## POST Request

simple POST request

```
curl -X POST --data "title=foo&body=bar" https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
```
-X : lets you change the HTTP method.
-d, - -data : sends the specified data in POST request

if you want to pass your data as regular JSON.

```
curl -X POST \
  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "title":"foo",
        "body":"bar"
      }'
```


this returns 
```

{
  id: 101,
  title: 'foo',
  body: 'bar',
  userId: 1
}

```


## PUT Request

simple PUT request

```
curl -X PUT -d "title=foo&body=bar" https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1
```


And if you want to pass your data as regular JSON.

```
curl -X PUT \
  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "title":"foo",
        "body":"bar"
      }'
```

## DELETE Request

```
curl -X DELETE https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1
```

## Download
We can also download files with CURL, for that use uppercase **'O'**
```
curl -O https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/3

```

## Run in Postman 

If you want to try above requests in your Postman client<br>
The below Run in Postman button imports and opens the collection of above [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) API endpoints directly in your Postman app.
