It not only helps me to see where work is flowing, queued or stalled but also to make our work as visible and transparent as possible.
To simplify, automate &amp;amp; improve GitHub issue management workflow therefore to scratch my own itch, I made a simple GitHub Probot app autotagger. It automatically tags the GitHub Issues based on the matched pattern.</description></item><item><title>CURL</title><link>https://aneesahammed.github.io/posts/curl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Oct 2018 11:36:55 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://aneesahammed.github.io/posts/curl/</guid><description>As part of my journey as a developer and decision to document my learning, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of writing a short post regarding curl, here it is.
Curl is a command line tool for transferring data to and from a server. Curl stands for Client URL and was developed by a Swedish developer Daniel Stenberg @bagder.
It covers many protocols like HTTP, FTP, IMAP, POP3 &amp;amp; SMTP, It usually comes pre-installed in most of Linux distros and modern versions of OS X.</description></item><item><title>Rapid Prototyping</title><link>https://aneesahammed.github.io/posts/rapid-prototype/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Aug 2017 10:36:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aneesahammed.github.io/posts/rapid-prototype/</guid><description>I want to share a recent remote consulting experience that reminded me why rapid prototyping is such a game-changer.
When you&amp;rsquo;re working with clients on mobile apps, getting clarity on design early is crucial. The prototype phase isn&amp;rsquo;t just important ‚Äì it&amp;rsquo;s where you either nail the user experience or spend months fixing it later.
The Tool Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Make the Prototype Sure, there are tons of dedicated prototyping tools out there.</description></item><item><title>XAML Styler for Visual Studio Mac</title><link>https://aneesahammed.github.io/posts/xaml-styler/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Aug 2017 11:36:55 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://aneesahammed.github.io/posts/xaml-styler/</guid><description>If you have already worked on WPF or any Windows Phone projects, you might have used the XAML Styler. Which is a visual studio extension for formatting XAML source code, which helps in maintaining better XAML coding style and better XAML readability.
Even though ‚ÄúVisual Studio for Mac‚Äù was available, I kept using Xamarin Studio because XAML Styler extension was not supported in VS for MAC.
Finally, Ben Lacey got a version compatible with VS for Mac.</description></item><item><title>Working with Microsoft</title><link>https://aneesahammed.github.io/posts/microsoft/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2017 11:36:55 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://aneesahammed.github.io/posts/microsoft/</guid><description>A couple of months back I got a chance to work with **Microsoft Middle East, Dubai¬†** to port the glimpses¬†win32 app into Microsoft Store.
It was really important for us to be able to take advantage of the best that windows 10 has to offer without rebuilding the glimpses app.
Desktop Bridge provided the perfect solution for us to be able to keep all the work we‚Äôve done before and embrace future, it is an obvious choice for us to give a more trustworthy source to users.</description></item><item><title>‚è∫Record your screen on Android!!</title><link>https://aneesahammed.github.io/posts/record-android-screen/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2017 10:36:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aneesahammed.github.io/posts/record-android-screen/</guid><description>Ever wanted to record a tutorial or wanted to create a demo of your app you&amp;rsquo;d need to capture the screen in real time.
